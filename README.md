# Autohotkey scripts
My AHK scripts. AHK version 1.1.28
### ` mousepan-v02.ahk `
Scrolls vertically with the mouse. Hold the right mouse button to scroll.  
Note: to block the system right mouse button (context menu popup) run "rbutton-block.ahk" -
it will prevent the rbutton system-wide. To invoke the context menu - just Shift- or Ctrl-click.
To bind another key - edit the script (see comments in file)
