# Autohotkey scripts
My AHK scripts. AHK version 1.1.28
### ` mousepan-v02.ahk `
This script provides a system-wide mouse scrolling functionality. 
Hold the right mouse button to scroll - more movements scrolls faster.  
For smoother scrolling set the scroll step to "1" in mouse setup:

Note: to block the system right mouse button (context menu popup) run "rbutton-block.ahk" -
it will block the Rbutton system-wide. To invoke the context menu - just Shift- or Ctrl-click.
To bind another key - edit the script (see comments in file)  

### ` rbutton-block.ahk `
Prevents the right mouse button system-wide.
